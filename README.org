* Istio Hands-On for Kubernetes

My notes from the course on Udemy.
* What is Istio?
- [[https://thenewstack.io/how-does-service-discovery-work-in-kubernetes/][Service discovery mechanism]] in kubernetes allows network calls among containers
- Service Mesh replaces the kubernetes service communication mechanism
  - All network calls go through the service mesh layer
  - The service mesh can apply *mesh logic* before the request is routed to the target container or it could run after, or both
- What sorts of stuff happens in the service mesh layer?
  - Telemetry
  - Potentially rerouting requests based on certain requirements (sounds familiar)
- Istio injects a container to each pod
  - This container is called a proxy.  The ones I've seen are named =istio-proxy=
  - In istio, the proxies communicate with the mesh layer and the app container.  App containers don't talk directly to the mesh layer or each other.
- Istio's got all sorts of obtuse nautical names that make it harder to understand when you're a newb
- They simplified some of the nautical names to a single =istiod= daemon (it used to be called "pilot" ðŸ™„) that lives in the =istio-system= pod in your cluster
  - This is referred to as the "control plane"
  - Kiali is a user interface pod in the control plane. Presumably its name will make sense at some point.
- What changes do we need to make to our application containers to make this work?
  - None! (in theory)
  - There are some changes you need to make for tracing
  - TODO determine whether we are using this sort of tracing

** Getting istio running
(in the warmup-exercise directory)
*** Apply the manifests to install istio
    #+begin_src sh
      kubectl apply -f 1-istio-init.yaml
    #+end_src

Sets up a namespace and initializes a lot of stuff
*** To remove
    #+begin_src sh
      kubectl delete -f 1-istio-init.yaml
    #+end_src
*** Apply the manifests to start istio
    #+begin_src sh
      kubectl apply -f 2-istio-minikube.yaml
    #+end_src

Creates a bunch of deployments in the istio namespace
*** Install the Kiali secrets file
    #+begin_src sh
      kubectl apply -f 3-kiali-secret.yaml
    #+end_src

The username and password are base64 encoded.  You can decode them with

#+begin_src sh
  echo "YWRtaW4=" | base64 -d
#+end_src
*** Injecting the istio-proxy sidecar
The istio-proxy is injected into each pod in a namespace via the istiod based on the presence of a label in the namespace.

#+begin_src sh
  kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
#+end_src
To remove:
#+begin_src sh
  kubectl label namespace default istio-injection-
#+end_src

Whew this syntax is garbage.  Sort of like deleting a branch in git used to require colons in a special place.  Much easier to use the manifest :)
